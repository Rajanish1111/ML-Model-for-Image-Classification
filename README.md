# ML-Model-for-Image-Classification
This project focuses on building and deploying a robust image classification model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The implementation is tailored for the CIFAR-10 dataset and leverages frameworks like TensorFlow and Sklearn for training, evaluation, and deployment.

##Features
Implementation of CNN architecture optimized for the CIFAR-10 dataset.
Use of data preprocessing techniques such as data augmentation, normalization, and resizing.
Integration of pre-trained models like ResNet and MobileNet for transfer learning.
Scalable and user-friendly frontend built with Streamlit Web Config.
Seamless deployment via Streamlit Cloud for real-time predictions.
